Sainsbury’s Design Test - Software Developer Front End

This test is intended to understand your knowledge using SASS and writing adequate
markup.
In order to complete this task you need to use the wireframes supplied and implement a
single html page.
There are only two devices we are interested into: mobile and desktop. You can decide the
width for the breakpoints.
On mobile, clicking on the “menu” link should display the menu entries to the user.
You can get as much creative as you want, while respecting the content layout
specifications.
While there is no specific time limit, we would expect you to spend no more than 2 hours on
it.
Feel free to explain briefly the problems you’ve encountered and the choices you’ve made
when returning the test. This is normally not necessary as the test should speak for itself.

Note​:

● We'll only be testing in Chrome so don't worry about cross­browser compatibility.
We’ll use Chrome’s device emulation to test the responsive version.
● The use of JS is discouraged.

Bonus Area

● No use of Bootstrap/Foundation.
● Make it cross­compatible. When returning the test, please make sure to specify what
are the browsers you’ve tested it on.
